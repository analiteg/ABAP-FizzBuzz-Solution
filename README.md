# FizzBuzz
Every developer knows a simple algorithmic problem from LeetCode called FizzBuzz (412). This task is pretty straightforward.

Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:
answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5;
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3;
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5;
answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

You can use loops from 1 to n and if-else conditions to solve this task. It takes you a maximum of 5 minutes. 

But if you want to demonstrate your OOP skills and new ABAP syntax and show a solution close to production, you can solve this task differently.

In the solution below, you can find a global and local classes, static and instance methods, method chaining, VALUE, FOR and COND operators, and others.

Add here a Unit Tests, and you'll get a solution of a task close to production.
